# From-solidity-course-to-vyper-py

The amazing [Beginner to Expert Full Course | Python Edition FreeCodeCamp course!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ) from [Patrick Collis](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC) was an amazing bootstrap to me for learning the smart contract stack (solidity/brownie).

I decided to learn Vyper by hands-on on project, this repo will share my learning journey. To do so, I will do my best to reproduce the Solidity course in Vyper.
